# Indie Studio - Object-Oriented Programming

Indie Studio is EPITECH's 2nd year end project.

The aim of the project is to implement a cross-platform 3D video game with real-world tools.

The game you must implement is a Bomberman-like game.
Our gameplay reference is Neo Bomberman, released on the Neo Geo and MVS systems in 1997.

Here’s the required features:
- Local multi-player with the possibility to play with a friend + AI’s controlled bots
- A main game menu (to start a new game or load an existing one)
- Your game must feature 3D graphics but a 2D gameplay
- Your game must feature procedurally generated maps (random obstacles, random bonuses etc.)
- Save/Load a game
- Animation and sounds to give life to the game (especially during various interactions)
- Power-ups (Bomb Up, Speed Up, Fire up, Wall Pass)

Online multiplayer was also implemented on this project as a bonus.
